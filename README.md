# DummyHighSchoolBSU

About: This is more for my own references than for a project I desire people to work on. It's a dummy school system that's a parody of CSU called "BSU" (Bear State University as opposed to Colorado State University).  The code maybe a little mangled because it was a group project and we all had various skill levels (YOU KNOW WHO I'M LOOKING AT STEVE!). It offers the following use cases: 1. CRUD an instructer/CRUD a class/CRUD assignment/CRUD grades/login for students/login for instructors/login for admins/view schedule for students and instructors....basically all the common use cases you'd expect from your online school management.  This didn't achieve as high of a project score as my other projects where I worked by myself....but meh, I'm hoping I'll find programming work that will give me a better team experience!

How to Run: Doesn't work since it requires a backend MySQL database. You'll have to create the database if you wish to run it (but it's a small and easy relational database with only like 5 tables you would need). But feel free to steal all the code here.
